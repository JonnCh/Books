# Books-Graphql
This is a graphql service that stores books and students on a local postgres database.

## Set Up
You need to have installed NodeJs and Postgres DB

Create a local database named "books"

Add your password for your local postgres db into config/config.json file.

Run the following commands:
 `npm i`
` npm run re-db`

## Start server

Just run `npm start`

## Testing
Inside this repository I included a postman collection that you can import, or you can use `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
